                        <p class="info-news">The Martichoras was allegedly a blue-eyed, human-faced wild beast of India. It was the size of the largest lion, with cinnabar-red fur. It has three rows of teeth, feet, and claws like lions. It also had a scorpion-like tail with a terminal sting that measured over 1 cubit, plus two rows of auxiliary stings, each a Greek foot long. The sting was instantly fatal. 

                            –  Indica, Ctesias, 5th Century
                           
                           The Manticore is a well-known beast in mythology and in many other fantasy worlds, but for SMITE, we wanted to look deeper. What were the origins of the Manticore? How did this beast come to be a figure in many different mythologies and modern creations? The first mention of the Manticore comes from an ancient Greek author by the name of Ctesias. He was traveling through Persia and got the first account of this creature from the locals who claimed it originated in India. He wrote about its monstrous features in great detail. Ctesias is the primary source that survived to spread the mythology of this creature across the globe, and so because of this Greek origin, we chose the Greek pantheon for Martichoras.
                           
                           This writing started to circulate among the other Greek writers and eventually spread through other regions. The name was spelled many different ways. Martichoras was the original name Ctesias recorded from the Persian pronunciation, and it was actually a European mistranslation of Aristotle’s works that resulted in it being called “Mantichoras.” This was the primary text that spread across the modern world, and led to the shortened “Manticore”, the most commonly used name nowadays. The monster was also referred to by its title as well, the man-eater, or Androphagon in Greek
                           
                           Martichoras is the first manticore ever recorded. He is “The” Manticore. In SMITE, he is the most ancient of the manticore species, and thus the most powerful and respected. He is the king among these terrifying beasts, and he is eager to take revenge on the gods who have treated him like a simple animal for so long</p>

                        <p class="info-news">For the monumental 10th year of SMITE, we knew we needed a special god. A god that embodied the traditional mythology of SMITE’s core pantheons, and one that would have a deeper meaning to long-term SMITE players. 

                            One character has been a focal point of SMITE since its inception but never got to experience the true glory of battle. This being was treated like a monster. A prisoner, destined to be slain repeatedly for the sport of the gods. Surtr, the Fire Giant, would finally have his revenge. 
                            
                            After a year of peace, the gods of SMITE have once again awakened a great force of destruction. The repeated experience of gruesome death has brought about an ascension from deep within him, and Surtr is finally able to break free of his prison and fight back against the gods of SMITE. No longer will he be chained to the mountain in the Conquest Map, Surtr now finally walks free!</p>
